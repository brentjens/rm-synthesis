RM-Synthesis Overview
=====================

(c) Michiel Brentjens <brentjens@astron.nl>

This Python script can perform a basic (dirty) RM-synthesis, given a
FITS cube with Stokes Q images, a FITS cube with Stokes U images, and
a text file containing the frequencies of these images. RM synthesis
is described in M.A. Brentjens & A.G. de Bruyn, A&A (2005).

Installation
------------

This script assumes that the numpy and pyfits libraries are installed.
Install using: 

    user@machine: /.../rm-synthesis-x.y$ python setup.py install.


Usage
-----

rmsynthesis [options] <Qcube.fits> <Ucube.fits> <frequencies.txt>

  -o/--output <directory>    Output directory (Default: .)

  -l/--low <phi>             Lowest Faraday depth in output cube.
                             Default value is 
                             -sqrt(3)/delta (lambda^2),
                             where delta (lambda^2) is the smallest
                             one as computed from the frequency list.

  -h/--high <phi>            Highest Faraday depth in output cube.
                             Default value is 
                             +sqrt(3)/delta (lambda^2),
                             where delta (lambda^2) is the smallest
                             one computed from the frequency list.
  
  -d/--dphi <delta phi>      Faraday depth increment between frames
                             from the RM cube. Default value is
                             sqrt(3)/Delta (lambda^2), where Delta
                             (lambda^2) is max(lambda^2) -
                             min(lambda^2), computed from the
                             frequency list.

  -f/--force                 Force overwriting files in output
                             directory if they already exist.

  -c/--check                 Perform all possible checks, but do not
                             write any files or compute an RM cube.

  -q/--qfactor <qf>          Factor to multiply values in Q cube with,
                             Default value is 1.0

  -u/--ufactor <uf>          Factor to multiply values in U cube with,
                             Default value is 1.0. For WSRT data, this
                             factor must be 1.2 if it has not already
                             been applied.


Input
-----

The Q and U fits cubes are required and must have three axes. The
fastest varying axis (AXIS1) must be right ascension, the second axis
(AXIS2) declination, and the slowest varying axis (AXIS3) is the frame
number. The rmsynthesis script ignores frequency information in the
FITS cubes. It only uses frequency information provided in the text
file. Note that the order of the axes in Python/numpy is the reverse
of that in the FITS file. That is, in Python, the first axis (axis 0)
is the slowest varying axis. The pyfits library transparently handles
this conversion. Note that the Q and U cubes must be similar in the
sense that their shape and scales (ra, dec, and frame number) must be
the same.

The third required input is the list of frequencies. This must be a
text file with one frequency per line. The frequency must be in Hz and
can be either an integer or a floating point number. A (tiny) example:

1.420e9
1680000000
4800000000


Output
------

The output files are written in the current working directory, unless
otherwise specified with the -o option. 

- p-rmcube-dirty.fits FITS cube with axis RA (AXIS1), Dec (AXIS2),
                      Faraday depth (AXIS3). Total linear polarization.

- q-rmcube-dirty.fits FITS cube with axis RA (AXIS1), Dec (AXIS2),
                      Faraday depth (AXIS3). Derotated Q.

- u-rmcube-dirty.fits FITS cube with axis RA (AXIS1), Dec (AXIS2),
                      Faraday depth (AXIS3). Derotated U.

- rmsf.txt            Text file with the RM spread function. The first
                      column is Faraday depth, the second column the
                      response parallel to the original polarization
                      direction ("q"), and the third column the
                      response at 45 degrees with respect to the
                      original polarization direction ("u").

- rmsynthesis.log     Contains the command line options used to obtain
                      this output.
